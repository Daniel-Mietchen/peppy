Welcome

``peppy`` is a python package that provides an API for handling standardized project and sample metadata. 
If you define your project as a standard `Portable Encapsulated Project <http://pepkit.github.io/>`_ (or PEP), you can use the ``peppy`` package to instantiate an in-memory representation of your project and all of its samples. You can then use this for interactive analysis, or to develop a novel python tool based on ``peppy`` so you don't have to handle sample processing.

``peppy`` is primarily useful to tool developers and data analysts who want a standard way of representing sample-intensive research project metadata. To get started, proceed with the :doc:`Introduction <intro>`.

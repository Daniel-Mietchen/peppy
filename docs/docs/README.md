# peppy

`peppy` is a python package that provides an API for handling standardized project and sample metadata. 
If you define your project as a standard [Portable Encapsulated Project](http://pepkit.github.io), or "PEP", 
you can use the `peppy` package to instantiate an in-memory representation of your project and all of its samples. 
You can then use this for interactive analysis, or to develop a novel python tool based on `peppy` so you don't have to handle sample processing.

`peppy` is primarily useful to tool developers and data analysts who want a standard way of representing sample-intensive research project metadata.

Portable Encapsulated Projects

This package aims to implement conceptual models corresponding to various aspects of a project workflow, from 
definition to deployment, execution to analysis. Primary design objectives have been balancing expressive power 
with a desire to maintain simplicity and--we hope--an object ecosystem that's not overly difficult to internalize 
and begin using intuitively. Standard structure for integration with complementary packages, and computing 
environment portability have also been of paramount importance.
